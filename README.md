> **Course Description:** 

In this course, design, implementation, and analysis of algorithms are discussed at the introductory level. The course covers basic algorithm design techniques, analysis of the correctness and the efficiency of algorithms, and issues regarding implementation of algorithms. The course introduces the elementary data structures which can be utilized in the algorithms.  In this course, the students design the algorithms with Java programming language in Eclipse environment. The course aims to equip the students with the ability of efficient algorithm design and academic presentation of the algorithms.

> **Course Objectives:** 

This course aims to prepare students for the challenging task of efficient algorithm design for various problems.  

> **Course Learning Outcomes (CLO):** 

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to;
1.	Write pseudocodes of iterative and recursive algorithms
2.	Implement algorithms in computer environment given their pseudocodes
3.	Analyze the runtime of iterative and recursive algorithms using asymptotic notation; compare algorithms in terms of their time efficiencies
4.	Recognize certain computational problems such as sorting and searching; implement basic algorithms for those problems, and comment on their suitability for particular problem instances
5.	Define fundamental characteristics and comprehend implementations of elementary data structures including arrays, lists, queues, stacks, and trees
6.	Define fundamental characteristics and comprehend implementations of a number of more advanced data structures; in particular, heaps, binary search trees, and graphs
